[{"content":"What is jBPF? jBPF stands for Janus BPF, an eBPF like program as part of janus project provided by microsoft. jBPF runs in user space mode unlike eBPF that runs in kernel stack, it is based on userspace BPF (uBPF). just like the developer said:\nUserspace eBPF instrumentation and control framework for deploying control and monitoring functions in a secure manner. It is part of Project Janus and provides probes for eBPF-like functionality outside of the Linux kernel.\nAs Telecom technology require low latency in such manner, eBPF comes for accomplish this requirement. eBPF already implemented in several usecases that require low latency and take control or modify metadata without interupt the process. In this telecom scenario also require this manner, and eBPF already proven to resolve this requirements, such as linux scheduler modification without interupt the entire process or kernel.\njBPF that part of janus project provided by microsoft already gives us the way to use eBPF instrumentation for Radio Access Network monitor and control utilization. The project you can find at here: https://github.com/microsoft/jbpf.git\nThe jbpf instrumentation and control library provides a flexible and safe user-mode instrumentation framework built on eBPF technology. It splits responsibilities between the core application developers and a potentially broader community of developers who want safe access to instrumentation and control, similar to eBPF in Linux kernel. However, jbpf operates entirely in user mode and makes no calls to Linux kernel.\nThe core application developers define common instrumentation points with access to important internal application structures and APIs, but without prescribing how these will be consumed. Other developers can deploy their own code, inlined, at the instrumentation points. It allows them to efficiently process internal application data in an arbitrary way to extract particular information without needing to copy it elsewhere. The instrumentation code is statically verified before executed to enforce safety.\njBPF Architecture jBPF literaly same with BPF workflow, there are metadatas that we can receive and also can be modify by the bpf prog. If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with eBPF or uBPF, that eBPF code will be compiled into bpf object file and could be load using bpftool or something else. In jBPF we don\u0026rsquo;t use bppftool to load the program, and the bpf object will called codelet in jBPF.\nThese are the basic terms used in the project:\nHook: An instrumentation point at which we call user-provided code (see here for more on hooks). Codelet: A piece of user-provided code that gets executed once a hook point is called in the application (see here for mo**re * on codelets). Codelet set: A set of codelets that share maps or other things and have to be deployed together. Map: A shared memory location that is accessible to one or more codelets, typically used to store data between in** vocaions, * share across codelets, or communicate with the rest of the system (see here for more on maps). Helper function: A function implemented by the application and exposed to the codelet, typically used to affect the application behaviour or perform complex operations that are hard to verify (see here for more on helper functions). srsRAN integration There is project for srsran integration with jbpf, you can go to jbpf repository and find the repo at there. Otherwise, I just create my integration by my self with reference by that repo. In my integration, I focuse on retrieve CU_CP telemetry, such as du_index, plmn and ue_index.\nModify the gnb.cpp We need to include jbpf headers file and our custom headers. Also we need to initialize the jbpf process. And the important part is you need to register the jbpf thread to srsran thread process, because jbpf is running inside it\u0026rsquo;s own thread.\n#include \u0026#34;srsran/jbpf/inc/jbpf.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;srsran/jbpf/inc/jbpf_hook.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;srsran/jbpf/inc/jbpf_defs.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;srsran/jbpf/jbpf_context.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;srsran/jbpf/common.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;srsran/jbpf/jbpf_srsran_hooks.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;srsran/jbpf/inc/jbpf.h\u0026#34; #define IPC_NAME \u0026#34;example_ipc_app\u0026#34; jbpf_io_stream_id_t control_input_stream_id = { .id = {0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11}}; jbpf_io_stream_id_t output_data_stream_id = { .id = {0x00, 0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0x77, 0x88, 0x99, 0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC, 0xDD, 0xEE, 0xFF}}; // Used to covert data of type Packet to JSON format boost::property_tree::ptree toPtree(const jbpf_cucp_uemgr_ctx_info\u0026amp; packet) { boost::property_tree::ptree pt; pt.put(\u0026#34;ctx_id\u0026#34;, packet.ctx_id); pt.put(\u0026#34;du_index\u0026#34;, packet.du_index); pt.put(\u0026#34;plmn\u0026#34;, packet.plmn); pt.put(\u0026#34;ue_index\u0026#34;, packet.ue_index); return pt; } std::string toJson(const boost::property_tree::ptree\u0026amp; pt) { std::ostringstream oss; boost::property_tree::write_json(oss, pt); return oss.str(); }; static void io_channel_print_output(jbpf_io_stream_id_t* stream_id, void** bufs, int num_bufs, void* ctx) { if (stream_id \u0026amp;\u0026amp; num_bufs \u0026gt; 0) { // Check that the data corresponds to a known output channel if (memcmp(\u0026amp;output_data_stream_id, stream_id, sizeof(jbpf_io_stream_id_t)) != 0) { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;ERROR: Unknown stream_id\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; return; } // Fetch the data and print in JSON format for (auto i = 0; i \u0026lt; num_bufs; i++) { jbpf_cucp_uemgr_ctx_info p = *static_cast\u0026lt;jbpf_cucp_uemgr_ctx_info*\u0026gt;(bufs[i]) ; boost::property_tree::ptree pt = toPtree(p); std::string json = toJson(pt); std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; json \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; // Send an acknowledgement message back to the codelet PacketResp resp = {1}; jbpf_send_input_msg(\u0026amp;control_input_stream_id, \u0026amp;resp, sizeof(resp)); } } } . . . // ======== START JBPF ========= // struct jbpf_config jbpf_config = {0}; jbpf_set_default_config_options(\u0026amp;jbpf_config); // Enable LCM IPC interface using UNIX socket at the default socket path (the default is through C API) jbpf_config.lcm_ipc_config.has_lcm_ipc_thread = true; snprintf( jbpf_config.lcm_ipc_config.lcm_ipc_name, sizeof(jbpf_config.lcm_ipc_config.lcm_ipc_name) - 1, \u0026#34;%s\u0026#34;, JBPF_DEFAULT_LCM_SOCKET); // Initialize jbpf if (jbpf_init(\u0026amp;jbpf_config) \u0026lt; 0) { exit(-1); } // Any thread that calls a hook must be registered jbpf_register_thread(); jbpf_register_io_output_cb(io_channel_print_output); // ======== END JBPF ========= // Write custom hook macro As the documentation guide, to working with jBPF we need hook point.

To do this we need to do some commands like below:\nThe error bpf_obj_get: No such file or directory indicates that the BPF map at the specified path (/sys/fs/bpf/events) doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist or wasn\u0026rsquo;t created correctly.\nTo fix this issue, you need to ensure the following:\n1. Ensure Your BPF Program Creates the Map Make sure that your BPF program creates a BPF map and pins it to the BPF filesystem (usually mounted at /sys/fs/bpf/).\nIn your BPF program, you should define the map like this:\nstruct { __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY); __uint(max_entries, 128); // Number of CPUs __type(key, u32); __type(value, u32); } events SEC(\u0026#34;.maps\u0026#34;); To pin the map to the BPF filesystem, you can use the following code in the user-space program that loads your BPF program:\nint map_fd = bpf_map__fd(skel-\u0026gt;maps.events); bpf_obj_pin(map_fd, \u0026#34;/sys/fs/bpf/events\u0026#34;); Or, if you\u0026rsquo;re manually loading the BPF program and pinning the map:\nbpftool prog load my_bpf_program.o /sys/fs/bpf/my_bpf_prog bpftool map pin id \u0026lt;map_id\u0026gt; /sys/fs/bpf/events 2. Mount the BPF Filesystem (if not already mounted) Ensure that the BPF filesystem is mounted:\nsudo mount -t bpf bpf /sys/fs/bpf/ This step may be required if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the BPF filesystem mounted on your system.\n3. Load and Pin the Map Correctly Make sure your user-space program or manual commands correctly load and pin the map in the BPF filesystem.\nIf you load the program manually and want to pin the map, you can use the bpftool utility:\nLoad the BPF program:\nsudo bpftool prog load my_bpf_program.o /sys/fs/bpf/my_bpf_prog Pin the map:\nsudo bpftool map pin id \u0026lt;map_id\u0026gt; /sys/fs/bpf/events Replace \u0026lt;map_id\u0026gt; with the ID of your map, which you can find using:\nsudo bpftool map show 4. Verify the Map Exists Once you\u0026rsquo;ve pinned the map, verify that it exists in the expected location:\nls /sys/fs/bpf/events If the file exists, your program should be able to access it without the bpf_obj_get error.\nRecap Ensure your BPF program creates and pins the map. Ensure the BPF filesystem is mounted. Load and pin the map correctly. After following these steps, your user-space program should be able to access the BPF map without errors. If you still encounter issues, please provide more details about your BPF program setup.\n","date":"21 August, 2024","id":2,"permalink":"/documentation/ebpf-sctp-tracing/","summary":"eBPF SCTP Trace Trace the Protocol ID and print it in kernel Protocol ID for SCTP is 132 and the program was successfully trace data that contain SCTP packet from CU to AMF.\nAlmost all telco protocols are SCTP based, like NGAP, F1AP, nFAPI, E1AP, E2AP, etc. With this filtering process using eBPF, I argue (hypothetically) that the filtering process is much faster because the process is not involve kernel.
