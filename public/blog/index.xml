      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe some of you have same issue like me, have a job but also have side project for fun. If you are like me, it means we are not alone. There are several people who like us, don&amp;rsquo;t worry :) &amp;ldquo;at first I thought I was alone LOL&amp;rdquo;. It is normal for a person who are incapable to do &amp;ldquo;a doing nothing&amp;rdquo; work. In this page, I would like to sharing my &amp;ldquo;Self Employed&amp;rdquo; work with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s began while I was studying my Diploma degree, or maybe when I was highschool student. I was a person that loves learning a new thing, especially strategy game. So despite I was going to school for study, sometimes I just go to school&amp;rsquo;s hall to play board game or became football tactic maker. And then this behavior continued until college. I&amp;rsquo;m very passionate in learning new thing and finally start my first self project, that I called &amp;ldquo;A Computer that can See&amp;rdquo;. It is basically just a computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For honest doing programming or computer science is just a hobby, actually my passion lay on pure science. But the universe guide me to join telecommunication engineering, and I decided to focused on computer science as the project reference. For me, it is fun to worked in this field and I became passionate with this field. Until I got my first job in Telecom industry, I still working on my project for pure science and computer science. Fortunately, those fields are related each other so I can work on those project together. Yeas every knowledge must be related each other in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
