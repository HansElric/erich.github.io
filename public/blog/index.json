There are several people who like us, don\u0026rsquo;t worry :) \u0026ldquo;at first I thought I was alone LOL\u0026rdquo;. It is normal for a person who are incapable to do \u0026ldquo;a doing nothing\u0026rdquo; work. In this page, I would like to sharing my \u0026ldquo;Self Employed\u0026rdquo; work with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s began while I was studying my Diploma degree, or maybe when I was highschool student. I was a person that loves learning a new thing, especially strategy game. So despite I was going to school for study, sometimes I just go to school\u0026rsquo;s hall to play board game or became football tactic maker. And then this behavior continued until college. I\u0026rsquo;m very passionate in learning new thing and finally start my first self project, that I called \u0026ldquo;A Computer that can See\u0026rdquo;. It is basically just a computer vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor honest doing programming or computer science is just a hobby, actually my passion lay on pure science. But the universe guide me to join telecommunication engineering, and I decided to focused on computer science as the project reference. For me, it is fun to worked in this field and I became passionate with this field. Until I got my first job in Telecom industry, I still working on my project for pure science and computer science. Fortunately, those fields are related each other so I can work on those project together. Yeas every knowledge must be related each other in some ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
