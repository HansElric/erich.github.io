Clearing the Confusion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) has exploded in popularity for observability, security, and networking on Linux. But if you‚Äôve browsed Reddit or Hacker News, you‚Äôve probably seen people claim:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e‚ÄúeBPF runs in userspace.‚Äù\n‚ÄúeBPF is a kernel bypass.‚Äù\n‚ÄúeBPF replaces DPDK!‚Äù\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet‚Äôs clear the fog. In this post, we‚Äôll walk through what eBPF really is, where it runs, and whether it qualifies as a ‚Äúkernel bypass.‚Äù\nüîç What Is eBPF?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt its core, eBPF is a virtual machine inside the Linux kernel that allows you to attach tiny programs to key parts of the system ‚Äî like syscalls, network packet processing, or tracing events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou write these eBPF programs in userspace, typically in C, and then load them into the kernel via a syscall (bpf()), where they are verified and JIT-compiled to native code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eüì¶ Written in userspace\n\nüöÄ Executed in kernel space\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eü§î So‚Ä¶ Is eBPF a Kernel Bypass?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. eBPF is not a kernel bypass. In fact, it‚Äôs the opposite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eeBPF runs inside the kernel and operates with kernel cooperation.\n\nIt extends the kernel's capabilities safely and dynamically.\n\nIt is sandboxed, verified, and runs in specific hook points (e.g., network ingress, syscall entry, kprobes, tracepoints, etc.).\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‚úÖ eBPF Enhances Kernel Behavior\n‚ùå eBPF Does Not Bypass the Kernel\nüßµ Why Do People Say eBPF ‚ÄúRuns in Userspace‚Äù?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere‚Äôs a grain of truth, but it‚Äôs misleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eeBPF code is developed and compiled in userspace.\n\nYou use userspace tools like clang, bpftool, bcc, libbpf, or bpftool prog load to load programs into the kernel.\n\nBut once loaded, eBPF programs run in kernel context, not in userspace.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaying ‚ÄúeBPF runs in userspace‚Äù is like saying \u0026ldquo;drivers run in Notepad because you wrote them there.\u0026rdquo; It‚Äôs true that you write them in userspace, but they run in kernelspace.\n‚ö° But What About XDP or AF_XDP?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are part of the eBPF ecosystem, especially in networking.\nTechnology\tRuns In\tDescription\nXDP\tKernel (very early)\tProcesses packets in the driver before the kernel stack. Used for fast packet filtering and redirection.\nAF_XDP\tUserspace\tA socket type that allows zero-copy packet I/O between NIC and userspace. Can act as a true kernel bypass.\nDPDK\tUserspace\tFull kernel bypass. Userland packet processing with direct NIC access via UIO or VFIO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if you want true kernel bypass, you‚Äôll use DPDK or AF_XDP in zero-copy mode. eBPF + XDP can drop or redirect packets before they hit the TCP/IP stack, but it‚Äôs still happening inside the kernel.\nüß† Summary\nStatement\t‚úÖ / ‚ùå\tClarification\neBPF runs in kernel space\t‚úÖ\tAfter loading, eBPF executes in the kernel\neBPF is a kernel bypass\t‚ùå\tIt extends the kernel, not bypasses it\nYou write eBPF in userspace\t‚úÖ\tThen it‚Äôs loaded into kernel\nXDP can avoid the kernel network stack\t‚ö†Ô∏è\tPartially true ‚Äî it avoids the full stack but is still in kernel\nAF_XDP and DPDK bypass the kernel\t‚úÖ\tThese give userland access to NICs\nüõ†Ô∏è Want to Go Deeper?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eBuild an XDP program to drop or redirect packets\n\nCompare DPDK vs AF_XDP vs XDP in real benchmarks\n\nTrace syscalls with eBPF using tools like bcc or bpftrace\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eüîö Conclusion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeBPF is a powerful in-kernel extension mechanism, not a bypass. If you\u0026rsquo;re aiming for extreme packet throughput or latency reduction in userland, consider AF_XDP or DPDK. But for safety, flexibility, and observability ‚Äî eBPF is unmatched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re confused by what runs where, just remember:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eYou write in userspace, but eBPF thinks in kernelspace.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n"

Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open source is a concept of accessible code base and we can modify the code by every one, also we can contribute to the development of the prject as a community (with some license of course). This concept was spread after linux was introduced to the world. As an IT concept open source was proven to accelerate the development for new technology by its opennes concept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"open-source-as-an-ideology\"\u003eOpen Source as an Ideology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I explained earlier, open source is about transparancy, collaboration and freedom.

This movement pushes back the centralized and monopolization of knowledge and power, against the monopolar hegemony and encourage the uni-polar system to distributed ownership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEducation: Open Knowledge for All\nThe rise of Open Educational Resources (OER) is democratizing access to learning.

On a bigger picture there are 2 systems that widely used, Republic and Monarchy. Those systems have its inheritance, but mostly it is republic and monarchy. If we saw the open source principle, it is closely to the republic idea but is it republic decentralized? community-driven? The republican enthusiast would say \u0026ldquo;yes!!!\u0026rdquo;, but is it really true? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. As Socrates critics to the republic, it will only produce the demagog. I saw in some countries that Socrates\u0026rsquo;s words come true. No community words taken, centralized system and disrepancy that occured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, open source priciple as an ideology is a \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;patch\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e for current republic idea. If we can apply the open source principle combined with republic idea, I think it will be a game changer for current governement system. As world growing, and world become monopolar that means only one super power country that acts as a world governmet (reminds me on one piece btw). This situation already predicted by Socrates, that even democratic system at some point would be worst as another system if a power lays on a single subject. Another block from east try to against this mono-polar like system with idea of collaboration, decentralization and transparancy. This head-to-head ideas brings by a powerful countries worth to wait, prepare the pop corn and cola to watch what look like this world ended up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"but-there-are-challenges\"\u003eBut There Are Challenges‚Ä¶\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen source isn‚Äôt perfect.
