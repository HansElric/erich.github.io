            "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eAs a tech enthusiast or IT engineer, we are already familiar with Open Source Software (OSS). Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open source is a concept of accessible code base and we can modify the code by every one, also we can contribute to the development of the prject as a community (with some license of course). This concept was spread after linux was introduced to the world. As an IT concept open source was proven to accelerate the development for new technology by its opennes concept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"open-source-as-an-ideology\"\u003eOpen Source as an Ideology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I explained earlier, open source is about transparancy, collaboration and freedom. Let\u0026rsquo;s think about it, if we contemplate this idea and then remove the code or software development concept, it becomes a powerful philosophical approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTransparancy:\u003c/strong\u003e Everyone can see how something works.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCollaboration:\u003c/strong\u003e Everyone can contribute to make it better or bigger, not just expert but anyone who have insight or ideas.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFreedom:\u003c/strong\u003e Anyone can modify or adopt the system to suit their needs.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis models contrasts sharply with many traditional system-corporate, governemental, also educational that often operate under hierarchy, secrecy and control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"open-source-as-a-social-movement\"\u003eOpen Source as a Social Movement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen treated as a movement, open source embodies principles that align closely with decentralization, community-driven action and equity. This movement pushes back the centralized and monopolization of knowledge and power, against the monopolar hegemony and encourage the uni-polar system to distributed ownership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEducation: Open Knowledge for All\nThe rise of Open Educational Resources (OER) is democratizing access to learning. Free textbooks, courses (like MIT OpenCourseWare or Khan Academy), and community-driven teaching platforms embody open-source ideals. Education becomes a shared responsibility—not a commodity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGovernment: Open Data and Civic Tech\nIn the public sector, movements for open data and open governance allow citizens to access and interpret information, hold institutions accountable, and even co-develop policies. Projects like Code for America apply open-source approaches to civic engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScience and Research: Collaborative Discovery\nThe traditional academic publishing model is being disrupted by open-access journals and platforms like arXiv and Sci-Hub. Researchers are increasingly sharing methods, data, and results in real-time, accelerating the pace of innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArt and Culture: Creative Commons\nPlatforms like Creative Commons allow artists to license their work in ways that encourage remixing, reuse, and collaboration. The idea of rigid copyright is softened, and creativity becomes more communal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"open-source-in-daily-life-even-if-youre-not-a-developer\"\u003eOpen Source in Daily Life (Even if You’re Not a Developer)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people are already living \u0026ldquo;open source\u0026rdquo; lives—they just don’t call it that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA gardener who shares plant cuttings and cultivation tips.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA teacher uploading free worksheets online.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn activist creating a toolkit for organizing that others can use and adapt.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open-source ideology empowers individuals and communities to own their tools, their knowledge, and their future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"governemnt-and-geopolotics-with-open-source-principles\"\u003eGovernemnt and Geopolotics with Open Source Principles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have several governement system that applied to the nations. On a bigger picture there are 2 systems that widely used, Republic and Monarchy. Those systems have its inheritance, but mostly it is republic and monarchy. If we saw the open source principle, it is closely to the republic idea but is it republic decentralized? community-driven? The republican enthusiast would say \u0026ldquo;yes!!!\u0026rdquo;, but is it really true? I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. As Socrates critics to the republic, it will only produce the demagog. I saw in some countries that Socrates\u0026rsquo;s words come true. No community words taken, centralized system and disrepancy that occured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, open source priciple as an ideology is a \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;patch\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e for current republic idea. If we can apply the open source principle combined with republic idea, I think it will be a game changer for current governement system. As world growing, and world become monopolar that means only one super power country that acts as a world governmet (reminds me on one piece btw). This situation already predicted by Socrates, that even democratic system at some point would be worst as another system if a power lays on a single subject. Another block from east try to against this mono-polar like system with idea of collaboration, decentralization and transparancy. This head-to-head ideas brings by a powerful countries worth to wait, prepare the pop corn and cola to watch what look like this world ended up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"but-there-are-challenges\"\u003eBut There Are Challenges…\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen source isn’t perfect. Whether in software or society, it comes with tough questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWho maintains and moderates open systems?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow do we fund contributions in a world driven by profit?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow do we prevent exploitation of free labor and ideas?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow do we ensure open doesn’t mean “lawless” or “unstructured”?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are ongoing debates—even within the software world—and they become even more complex when applied to broader societal models. Yeah there are no perfect or ideal concept o ideology, we just need to rethink and patch our ideology to fit our necesities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"references\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software\"\u003ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://codeforamerica.org/\"\u003ehttps://codeforamerica.org/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n"

I was a person that loves learning a new thing, especially strategy game. So despite I was going to school for study, sometimes I just go to school\u0026rsquo;s hall to play board game or became football tactic maker. And then this behavior continued until college. I\u0026rsquo;m very passionate in learning new thing and finally start my first self project, that I called \u0026ldquo;A Computer that can See\u0026rdquo;. It is basically just a computer vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor honest doing programming or computer science is just a hobby, actually my passion lay on pure science. But the universe guide me to join telecommunication engineering, and I decided to focused on computer science as the project reference. For me, it is fun to worked in this field and I became passionate with this field. Until I got my first job in Telecom industry, I still working on my project for pure science and computer science. Fortunately, those fields are related each other so I can work on those project together. Yeas every knowledge must be related each other in some ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
