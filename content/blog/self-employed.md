Maybe some of you have same issue like me, have a job but also have side project for fun. If you are like me, it means we are not alone. There are several people who like us, don't worry :) "at first I thought I was alone LOL". It is normal for a person who are incapable to do "a doing nothing" work. In this page, I would like to sharing my "Self Employed" work with you.

It's began while I was studying my Diploma degree, or maybe when I was highschool student. I was a person that loves learning a new thing, especially strategy game. So despite I was going to school for study, sometimes I just go to school's hall to play board game or became football tactic maker. And then this behavior continued until college. I'm very passionate in learning new thing and finally start my first self project, that I called "A Computer that can See". It is basically just a computer vision.

For honest doing programming or computer science is just a hobby, actually my passion lay on pure science. But the universe guide me to join telecommunication engineering, and I decided to focused on computer science as the project reference. For me, it is fun to worked in this field and I became passionate with this field. Until I got my first job in Telecom industry, I still working on my project for pure science and computer science. Fortunately, those fields are related each other so I can work on those project together. Yeas every knowledge must be related each other in some ways.
